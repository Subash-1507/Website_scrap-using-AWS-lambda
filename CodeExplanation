2. Defines the [`lambda_handler`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FSubash.Murugan%2FDownloads%2Fscrap%2Flambda_function.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "lambda_function.py") function, which is the entry point for the Lambda execution. It takes two parameters: [`event`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FSubash.Murugan%2FDownloads%2Fscrap%2Flambda_function.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%5D "lambda_function.py") and [`context`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FSubash.Murugan%2FDownloads%2Fscrap%2Flambda_function.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A26%7D%5D "lambda_function.py"). These parameters are provided by the Lambda service and contain information about the event that triggered the function and the runtime environment.

3. Sets the URL of the website to be scraped.

4. Sends a GET request to the specified URL using the [`requests.get()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FSubash.Murugan%2F.vscode%2Fextensions%2Fms-python.vscode-pylance-2024.6.1%2Fdist%2Ftypeshed-fallback%2Fstubs%2Frequests%2Frequests%2F__init__.pyi%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../.vscode/extensions/ms-python.vscode-pylance-2024.6.1/dist/typeshed-fallback/stubs/requests/requests/__init__.pyi") function and assigns the response to the [`response`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FSubash.Murugan%2FDownloads%2Fscrap%2Flambda_function.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "lambda_function.py") variable.

5. Checks if the GET request was successful by verifying that the status code of the response is 200 (indicating a successful request).

6. If the request was successful, the function proceeds to extract the content of the webpage using BeautifulSoup. It creates a BeautifulSoup object by passing the webpage content and the parser type ([`html.parser`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FProgram%20Files%2FPython312%2FLib%2Fhtml%2F__init__.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../Program Files/Python312/Lib/html/__init__.py")) to the [`BeautifulSoup`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FSubash.Murugan%2F.vscode%2Fextensions%2Fms-python.vscode-pylance-2024.6.1%2Fdist%2Ftypeshed-fallback%2Fstubs%2Fbeautifulsoup4%2Fbs4%2F__init__.pyi%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "../../.vscode/extensions/ms-python.vscode-pylance-2024.6.1/dist/typeshed-fallback/stubs/beautifulsoup4/bs4/__init__.pyi") constructor.

7. Extracts all the text from the webpage using the [`get_text()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FSubash.Murugan%2F.vscode%2Fextensions%2Fms-python.vscode-pylance-2024.6.1%2Fdist%2Ftypeshed-fallback%2Fstubs%2Fbeautifulsoup4%2Fbs4%2Felement.pyi%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A55%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "../../.vscode/extensions/ms-python.vscode-pylance-2024.6.1/dist/typeshed-fallback/stubs/beautifulsoup4/bs4/element.pyi") method of the BeautifulSoup object. The extracted text is assigned to the [`data`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FSubash.Murugan%2FDownloads%2Fscrap%2Flambda_function.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A23%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "lambda_function.py") variable.

8. Prints the first 500 characters of the extracted data for debugging purposes.

9. Checks if any data was extracted from the webpage.

10. If data was found, the function proceeds to upload the data to an AWS S3 bucket. It specifies the bucket name, creates an S3 client using `boto3.client('s3')`, prepares the data for S3 by encoding it as UTF-8, generates a dynamic file name with a timestamp, and attempts to upload the data to the S3 bucket using the `put_object()` method of the S3 client.

11. If the upload is successful, it prints a success message along with the file name and returns `True`. If any exceptions occur during the upload process, it catches the specific exceptions ([`FileNotFoundError`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FSubash.Murugan%2F.vscode%2Fextensions%2Fms-python.vscode-pylance-2024.6.1%2Fdist%2Ftypeshed-fallback%2Fstdlib%2Fbuiltins.pyi%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1942%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "../../.vscode/extensions/ms-python.vscode-pylance-2024.6.1/dist/typeshed-fallback/stdlib/builtins.pyi"), `NoCredentialsError`, `ClientError`) and prints corresponding error messages, then returns `False`.

12. If no data was found on the webpage, it prints a message indicating that and returns `False`.

13. If the GET request was not successful (status code other than 200), it prints a message indicating the failure and returns `False`.
